Minimum Deletions to Make String Balanced
This repository provides a solution to the problem of finding the minimum deletions required to make a string balanced. A string is considered balanced if there is no pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and s[i] = 'b' and s[j] = 'a'.

Problem Description
Given a string s consisting only of characters 'a' and 'b', you need to return the minimum number of deletions required to make the string balanced.

A string is balanced if there are no indices such that a 'b' appears before an 'a'.

Example 1:
Input: "aababbab"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can delete characters at indices 2 and 6 to form the string "aaabbb" or delete at indices 3 and 6 to form "aabbbb".

Example 2:
Input: "bbaaaaabb"
Output: 2
Explanation: The only solution is to delete the first two characters to form "aaaaabb".

Approach
The solution iterates through the string and tracks the counts of 'a' and 'b', calculating the minimum deletions required to ensure that all 'b' characters come before any 'a' characters.

Constraints
1 <= s.length <= 10^5
Each character in s is either 'a' or 'b'.
Technologies Used
String manipulation
Greedy algorithm
How to Use
Clone the repository.
Run the provided solution in your preferred environment.
Provide a string s of characters 'a' and 'b' as input.
The solution will output the minimum number of deletions required to balance the string.
